# Usage Instructions
Freeform Values must be used within the `{exp:freeform:form}` tag pair.

If the form has been submitted (and failed validation), the `{freeform:value:FIELD_NAME}` template tag is set to the previously-submitted value. Otherwise, it's set to an empty string.

For example:

`````php
<input name="email" type="email" value="{freeform:value:email}">
`````

You can also use the tag in conditionals, like this:

`````php
<input name="newsletter" type="checkbox" value="Y"
  {if '{freeform:value:newsletter}' == 'Y'}checked{/if}>
`````
